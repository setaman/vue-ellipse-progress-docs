| type    | values                                 | default |
|---------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| String  |"center \| out \| out-over \| in \| in-over \| top \| bottom [offset]" |"center"  |

Descriptive string in form `"mode [offset]"` that defines, how the progress line is aligned in relation to empty line.
The first value ist the `mode` and the optional second is the `offset` that is any negative or positive 
Number and defines the distance between the progress and empty lines. `offset` can be only combined with the `in` and `out` 
modes. You can understand the modes as the presets that help you to align lines as you want to.

| `out`|  the progress line is outside the empty line|
