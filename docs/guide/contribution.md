# Contribution

Imitated as a small experiment, this project is currently gaining some attention. 
Between my job and studies I always try to invest some time in development. 
The help from the open source community is very appreciated. 
Feel free co contribute to this small project, whenever you see a bug, have a question or know how to improve the component.
You can start with an existing issue or propose you own concern.

## Issues

Have you seen a bug or want to suggest a new feature? Let's discuss it in an issue. I prefer issues to PRs, because 
issues help us to organize ourselves better and finally decide if a PR is necessary and who should be responsible for it. 
In this way we can avoid unnecessary effort. Give a concise description of your request, share your setup and any other 
information that is relevant. The following points can be very useful in most cases:

+ Used library version
+ OS, Browser, Browser version
+ Device
+ Screenshots (if visual issue noticed)
+ Reproduction link (CodeSandbox, CodePen or similar)

## Pull requests (PRs)

In a PR you can implement new features, fix a bug, improve the documentation or just add a new cool example to the demo site. 
However, before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

+ I recommend that you submit an issue first to discuss your intentions.
+ When issuing PRs that change code, make your changes in a new git branch based on dev. Do not merge any code changes in the master!
+ Your commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits specification.
+ Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide. Always run npm run lint to check for possible code style problems.
+ Run the full unit test suite before submitting and make sure all tests pass. 
+ If the PR introduces a new feature or fixes an issue, please add/update/extend the appropriate test case. Also, make sure to update the documentation. 
+ Do not forget compatibility. When adding new features, please test them (if possible) in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari...) on different platforms (Android, IOS...).
+ If your PR satisfies all points, I will merge it into the dev branch, test the introduced changes live on the demo page and finally release a new stable version.

I thank you in advance for your contribution!
